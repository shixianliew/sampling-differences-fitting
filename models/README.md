# Models

This model is adapted from Danielle Navarro's sampling_frames_model found
in [https://github.com/djnavarro/sampling-differences](https://github.com/djnavarro/sampling-differences). 99.9% of this model code is her work, and it has been adapted here to allow for relatively easy fitting procedures.
