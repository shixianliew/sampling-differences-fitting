# Analysis

This folder contains the scripts used to fit models to individual (`fit_model_ind.R`) and aggregated (`fit_model.R`) data. 

Before running these scripts, specify the experiment data you want to fit to (as either "E1" or "E2" on line 11 of either script). The scripts should generate csv files that contain the optimised parameter values and fit measure.
